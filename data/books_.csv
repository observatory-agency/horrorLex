Spooky kids, as she demonstrates, are typically depicted as victims of long-ago traumas, who haunt the present as ""a challenge to the entrenched security, coherence, and power of adult knowledge and discourse.""]""

Balanzategui begins with well-known examples of children in 1980s American horror cinema. These are not the Satanically possessed children of the 1970s (The Exorcist, etc.) -- they remain completely human, yet also ""Other,"" and cause psychological entanglements with adults, such as Danny and his father in The Shining (1980). This and other key films (The Changeling, Poltergeist) also draw upon classic Freudian concepts such as doubling and traumatic repetition, reflecting shifting social structures and greater autonomy of children as economic agents. By the end of the 1990s, spirituality and the drive to find one's ""inner child"" had invaded American popular culture, bringing us cinematic children such as Cole in The Sixth Sense (1999), who guides oblivious adults through their concealed pasts and personal traumas.

The author also takes up the particularly striking use of uncanny children in films from two different areas of the world: Spain and Japan. In Spain, directors such as Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone) have chosen to grapple with the nation's collective memory of Francoist violence through the figure of a child seer who is caught between worlds. In Japan, starting with Ringu (1998) and the resulting J-horror boom, filmmakers have also focused on ghostly girls and boys. Balanzategui suggests this reflects national unease after the slump that followed the go-go midcentury Japanese economy. Sadako and others like her, especially as mediated through soon-to-be-obsolete technology like videotapes, are also a remodelling of the ""internal alien,"" or an unfamiliar or unwanted second self.

Finally, Balanzategui comments on certain international co-productions and remakes (The Ring, e.g.), which have tended to uproot the supernatural child from its home in a particular place. Such children have become a ""key unifying trope"" of horror films around the world at the turn of the 2000s, reflecting both millennial anxieties and a ""globally resonant shift in conceptualizations of childhood.""","The Bad Seed (1956)

Job done, then. Bankrolled by a generous pot of public funds aimed (with curious imprecision) at building national pride, Canadians in the '70s and '80s made more than their share of horror and exploitation films, including numerous rip-offs of American and European hits. Vatnsdal begins with the repressed demons in 1962's The Mask, moves through the experiments with early '70s schlock (including Ivan Reitman's Cannibal Girls), and spends time with the big Hollywood North classics like Black Christmas, My Bloody Valentine, and Cronenberg's entire ouevre. 

Along the way, Vatnsdal does, eventually, come to understand what Canuck-o-Vision is: a fuzzy glow to the frames, small-town settings, underacting, and those accents! But whatever makes a film ""smell Canadian,"" the country's contribution to horror cinema is legendary, and Vatnsdal's attention to detail to both the high and low art of this period borders on the obsessive (in a good way).","American Mary (2012)

Instead, we, as owners of physical bodies who understand vulnerability, discomfort, pain, identify with the representation of his/her body -- as in the Saw series, when we grimace and turn away at scenes of gore and dismemberment even when reprehensible characters are the victims.","Aldana Reyes, Xavier - Mobilising Affect: Somatic Empathy and the Cinematic Body in Distress

Forshaw's ode to Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs (1991) begins with unconditional praise for Thomas Harris, the author of the adapted novel as well as the entire Hannibal Lecter series, and ""now the yardstick by which all other modern thriller novelists are judged."" While a bit breathless, Forshaw does well to remind us that Silence (the film) did not arise in a vaccum, but rather took full advantage of Harris's best-selling plotting, pacing, and knack for dialogue. 

From there, Forshaw spends most of this volume performing a scene-by-scene read of the film. He deconstructs particularly resonant set pieces (such as the meticulously structured initial meeting between Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter, and Lecter's killing of the guards, ""an almost text-book example of audience manipulation"") and highlights the award-winning performances from Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, and Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill). While Forshaw limits himself almost entirely to a textual read of the film, he does occasionally go below surface level, pointing to Silence's recurrent themes: socioeconomic class, duality, and metamorphosis. In an interesting aside, he identifies the latter as the true purpose of Buffalo Bill's likely faux homosexuality or transgender identity, an aspect of the film that triggered unexpected (although arguably deserved) controversy.

Sandwiching Forshaw's walk-through of the film are his discussions of the progenitors of Silence -- including Psycho but also Manhunter, the first Harris adaptation and Lecter cinematic appearance -- and its successors. In the latter category, he must acknowledge the head-scratching (and rushed) Hannibal and the polarizing Hannibal Rising, plus the crime procedurals of David Fincher (Se7en, Zodiac).

Throughout, Rose makes the case for viewing the film as a modern take on gothic tropes and Freud's concept of the uncanny.","Eggshells (1969)

Carrie, arguably the best film adaptation of a Stephen King novel, gets the full treatment. Author Mitchell argues that the film ""is a clear product of '70s America,"" reflecting the decade's upheaval in terms of gender, youth vs. age, and trust in authorities. ""Human monsters"" -- including those, like Carrie White, who play a dual role of antagonist and hero -- began overshadowing more animalistic baddies on screen, violence became more graphic, and film resolutions became more nihilistic. Within this context, Mitchell analyzes the film's major themes of religion, the supernatual (and its link to Carrie White's pubescent status), adolescence, gender, and authority, plus its recurring motifs, such as blood and duality/split images. 

The rest of the book is dedicated to the basics: the writing of the novel (a project that King, famously, nearly abandoned) and Carrie White's real-life inspiration; a biographical sketch of director Brian DePalma, including a detailed account of his filmmaking style up to Carrie and consideration (and the author's rejection) of his alleged misogyny;production history of the film; scene-by-scene review; and critical reception and influence.","Body Double (1984)

John Carpenter's 1982 film The Thing may go down in horror history as the film most reviled upon its release but most beloved with the passage of time. Conolly dedicates this monograph to the film's legacy.

Conolly deliberately eschews the linear plot walk-through approach, although he does provide a quick and entertaining mini-summary. He then gets into the meat of the film with essays on its most salient attributes: the visual landscape of the film, a blanket of harsh white wilderness that has inspired numerous stories of other-worldly arctic beasts (as well as the source material for the film, John Campbell's Who Goes There?); the look of Carpenter's Thing monster, a twisted, gory nightmare reflecting the particular anxieties of the late '70s/early '80s, and contributing mightily to what we know call ""body horror""; the gliding movement and framing of the camera; and its famously bleak ending. 

Here and there, Conolly also offers novel insights and theories, such as his suggestion that the Thing bears a magnetic pull that throws off the laws of physics, turning the inside to the outside, up to down. He also notices subtle plot cues and unanswered questions that even dedicated fans may have missed.

Given Halloween (1978)'s place in history as one of the most popular and influential horror films, as well as the ur text for modern slashers, there is a rich body of information about it already recorded. As a result, this book could have been a mere summarization of all the standard backstory and making-of facts that can be found on innumerable special edition DVDs. But this is no Halloween 101; this is Advanced Halloween Studies. Leeder has an eagle eye for the enduring debates about this film that matter the most, and brought a few new ones to the class.

Some of Leeder's analysis is textual, such as his praise for the deft use of the floating Panaglide camera and how Michael Myers' movements are punctuated by sparse music and stingers. He also discusses in detail the added scenes in the extended TV edition of the film; useful, given that that version is rare. 

The bulk of this book, however, is devoted to more conceptual topics. Leeder gives an entire chapter to history of the Halloween holiday and the film's deliberate evocation of its themes of childhood mischief and masked anonymity. He also draws a portrait of Dr. Loomis as a (failed) psychiatrist and finds parallels in the narrative with Lovecraft - two angles not covered in other writings on Halloween. Throughout, Leeder draws upon his own interviews with director John Carpenter, which provide new insights.","Black Christmas (1974)

Right away, author Heller-Nicholas sets aside common criticism of Suspiria that it doesn't make a lick of sense. Appreciating the film is ""not so much to understand [it] intellectually"" but ""experience it sensorially,"" she writes. Suspiria,often said to be director Dario Argento's finest film, intentionally flouts traditional cinematic plotting and ""aggressively mocks any attempt at realism."" 

After a lightning-round overview of the Italian horror tradition and Argento's oeuvre, Heller-Nicholas spends the bulk of the book on the inspiration for Suspiria (including a focus on Daria Nicolodi's role, a fact often neglected by other authors), its production, a scene-by-scene analysis, and reception. The book is peppered with quotations from interviews with cast and crew, and includes the full text of the author's personal interview with Suspiria cinematographer, Luciano Tovoli. The latter is a real treat, especially when Tovoli recounts his initial proposal of literally throwing paint in primary colors onto the actors, and ultimately settling for the use of colored velvets over the lights.","Another (2014)

Turner pens this monograph about the still-infamous found-footage horror film The Blair Witch Project, which, just before the turn of the millennium, changed the face of independent film production forever. The micro-budgeted and sparse story -- three twenty-somethings venture into a Maryland forest in pursuit of a legendary child-killing witch -- was an unlikely candidate to cause a sea change in the world of cinema. Yet even before its release, its reputation was made as a ""glowing example of what could be achieved with cheap emerging technology, imagination and a less is more approach.""

Turner first turns to the mechanics of the film, focusing on the filmmakers' novel approach to financing and the film's production. Notable here are the details on the extremely Method tactics enforced by the directors -- essentially, throwing the three actors into the woods, tired, hungry, and terrorized in the night by hidden cast members, and then making them improvise the dialogue as well as keep the handheld cameras rolling.

Here is where many monographs dive into the ""meaning"" of the film. But as Turner implicitly acknowledges, the legacy of Blair Witch is not about its textual interpretation, but rather its cultural impact, of which the faux-documentary style and marketing of the film was undeniably the largest part. The author pieces together what made Blair Witch so effective in purporting to be the real footage of a real documentary crew, including its reliance on well-known cinéma verité techniques, plus the impact of its subjective, diagetic camera. Turner also devotes a chapter to the unprecedented viral marketing campaign that surrounded the film, including its website (blairwitch.com) that ""completely destabilized audience perceptions of the film as either real or fake.""","The Blair Witch Project (1999)

The Curse of Frankenstein (Devil's Advocates Series),"Harmes, Marcus K.","9781906733858 (paperback)

Auteur, 2015.",,,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Curse_of_Frankenstein/tnRaBgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27758253-the-curse-of-frankenstein,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/931866019,"(Auteur's Devil's Advocates is a series of books devoted to exploring the classics of horror cinema.)

Right off the bat, Harmes recognizes the dubious legacy of The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) as the film that launched the gothic period of Hammer Films. While wildly popular for a long stretch, Hammer's films eventually dropped off in creativity and quality, becoming little more than sexploitation. As the author notes, ""Curse is thus not only regarded as the beginning of a tradition, but a tradition that outstayed its welcome."" He refuses to assign Curse to the dustbin of history, however, and insists it be recognized as a revolutionary change in British cinema. 

Much of the book is taken up by Harmes' meditation on what constitutes a successful film adaptation of literature, firmly rejecting the idea that faithfulness to the text is the sine qua non. Instead, Harmes argues, in Curse, director Terence Fisher created a ""dramatically powerful hybrid"" of literary adaptation and disparate film styles, creating an ultimate product that shows adaptation can work in a ""more organic and provocative"" manner. Moreover, the film almost single-handedly restarted the concept of the British horror film, in shocking fashion. What was derided at the time as excessive gore (e.g., detached eyeballs demurely placed into a glass jar) would hardly raise an eyebrow today, but in an era when Royal Navy epics and stuffy costume dramas were what passed for national cinema, detached body parts ""must have seemed freakishly bizarre."" 

In his deep-dive into the film, Harmes also notes details that will likely interest fans of Curse, such as the starkness of the Eastman color process, making reds garishly pop; parallels between Curse and the similarly derided Peeping Tom (1960); and the relationship between Hammer's films and those of the older, more established Gainsborough studios.","The Curse of Frankenstein (1957)

His book celebrates the British horror film and its ""fascination with the seamy, the sensational, and the sometimes staggeringly tasteless.""

Frightmares is partly a narrative history and partly a well-curated encyclopedia of key films, actors, and directors, with mini-essays discussing the contribution of each scattered throughout the book. Cooper begins with pre-1950s ""shockers,"" the gems of which were overshadowed by the big American successes such as Frankenstein. Then, a long chapter devoted to the films of Hammer Studios, perhaps England's greatest genre export, with a focus on lesser-known examples of their productions, such as Horrors of the Black Museum (1959). The next chapters cover three decades of Brit film: the 1970s rise of AIP studios, Roger Corman, and Vincent Price (e.g., Dr. Phibes); the darker tone of the ""grim '70s"" (Death Line, Frenzy); and the 1970s influx of foreign directors. Cooper concludes with a look at the ""dog days"" of British horror and censorship (the ""video nasties"" debate) and the new wave of British horror that arose after the new millennium (The Kill List).","Note: The book mentions nearly every British horror film produced.

Scovell starts his tour with the ""trinity"" of folk horror (Witchfinder General, Blood on Satan's Claw, and The Wicker Man) each of which arose from British counterculture of the 1960s, when paganism and witchcraft were no longer considered pure fantasy. 

The remaining chapters are organized by topic: the horror of topography, where Scovell concentrates on episodes of 1960s-1980s BBC television that depicted hauntings springing from the land itself; rurality, primarily in the British Isles (seen in Hammer films and Straw Dogs) but also abroad (Haxan, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Onibaba); and the rise of occultism in film to explore modern prejudices and ethics (Burn, Witch, Burn; The Devils), including through depictions of the ""urban wyrd"" (Death Line). He ends with a nod to the modern folk horror revival. While heavily powered by nostalgia, these newer works often link modern political issues to folk narratives. Here, he examines (among others) The Witch (which ""put folklorically psychological material back into the cinematic mainstream"") and director Ben Wheatley's Kill List and A Field in England.","The ABCs of Death (2012)

As with most of the Devil’s Advocates volumes, Mee dispenses with a scene-by-scene breakdown, focusing instead on The Shining's legacy and its status as a particularly bright spot in director Stanley Kubrick’s eclectic oeuvre. 

Mee devotes a chapter to the now-infamous rift between Kubrick and author Stephen King, providing a well-researched account of the director’s approach to adapting King’s novel for the screen and King’s frustration with Kubrick’s seeming lack of appreciation for the supernatural aspect of the storyline. In Chapter 4, Mee explores The Shining's place in the post-Psycho horror pantheon that locates horror within the nuclear family. Here, the author offers a defense of Shelley Duvall’s performance as Wendy and discusses the arguably racist turn of the African-American character Dick Halloran from survivor-hero into mere slaughter fodder. 

Mee ends with a fascinating chapter on the significant amount of marketing of the film upon release, which was largely undone by critics' and audiences' collective head-scratching, which Mee chalks up to an unfair expectation that The Shining would be a straight-forward horror tale. But as she notes, if history is the judge, The Shining has eventually triumphed, and leaves a litany of pop-culture references in its shadow.","The Amityville Horror (1979)

Candyman was a breath of fresh air in the otherwise stagnating horror scene of 1992, a non-sequel with an original storyline and a strangely romantic, compelling monster. In this entry in the Devil's Advocates series, author Towson pays tribute to this enduring film and explores its meaning. He provides all the standard mechanics — an introduction to Clive Barker (on whose short story Candyman is based) and director/screenwriter Bernard Rose, casting and production trivia, discussion of the reception by audiences and critics, and a nod to the sequels. 

The meat of the book is Chapter 4, Towlson’s scene-by-scene, textual analysis of the film in which he grapples with the twin centers of the movie — race and gender — albeit with a much heavier focus on the latter. Towlson examines the character of Helen (Virginia Madsen) in light of the concepts of abjection and the “Paranoid Woman” trope, and notes that ultimately, the film is about her transcendence. Yet he recognizes “making a white woman the focus of a film that ostensibly tackles the subject of racist remains, for many critics, problematic.” Upon surveying many others' viewpoints, he concludes that the film is simultaneously racially progressive and regressive (although certainly does not provide the last word on the matter). 

At the back of the book is a new interview with Rose from 2016 in which he reflects on his career in film and music videos, and identifies the biggest film influences on Candyman, mostly from Polanski.","Aliens (1986)

Frenzy, Hitchcock's penultimate film, may be his most disreputable. ""Repulsive,"" it was called at the time; the film's explicit depiction of rape-murders by the ""Necktie Strangler"" and overall deep-1970s English grime left a bad taste in many a viewer's (and reviewer's) mouth. Author Cooper does not exactly defend the film, but he does help one better understand its place in Hitchcock's oeuvre. 

Cooper begins this bite-sized book (less than a hundred mini-pages) with a history of three, real-life ""genteel, polite yet brutal killers"" with whom Hitchcock seemed so taken. They, along with Arthur La Bern's novel Goodbye Piccadilly, Farewell Leicester Square, inspired certain earlier films as well as Frenzy. Cooper next provides pages of facts on the casting, locations, and production, including some choice bits of gossip -- such as Michael Caine refusing a lead role after finding the script ""disgusting."" Eschewing the typical scene-by-scene breakdown, Cooper instead addresses major themes of the film: fascination with ""the British Murder,"" food/sex imagery, depictions of rape and mistreatment of women, and why films of the '70s exuded such notable sleaze.","10 Rillington Place (1971)

Author Blyth goes to bat for John Carpenter's underseen and underloved 1994 film, In the Mouth of Madness. In just over 100 tiny pages, he does his best to establish that the film is ""a sophisticated think piece on horror, exploring the deep philosophical and socio-political implications of a then-unfashionable genre.""

Blyth first places the movie in the context of the mid-1990s (pre-Scream) dull spot in horror history, noting that even Carpenter himself admitted ""it's a bad time for horror."" After a quick film recap and an introduction to Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy (In the Mouth of Madness being the final of the three), Blyth devotes a chapter to the Lovecraftian inspiration for the film, declaring that Carpenter is one of the few filmmakers who has seriously attempted to bring Lovecraft's vision of cosmic horror to the screen. More than a simple monster movie, Madness evokes ""devastating, pessimistic nihilism."" Another chapter is dedicated to Stephen King, the clear inspiration for main character Sutter Cane, and other literary antecedents. In the remaining chapters, Blyth explores major themes of the film: theology and fanaticism (including parallels with Scientology); self-reflexivity, as a horror film about horror; and ""seeing"" in a literal and figurative sense.","In the Mouth of Madness (1994)

Author Grimm provides a short study of It Follows, the breakout indie horror hit of 2014. This is primarily a personal, textual reading, peppered by Grimm's unremarkable (and sometimes arguable) observations about the horror genre. That said, Grimm provides a few discussion-worthy asides about the film, including a meditation on what the nature of what ""it"" is (clearly supernatural, but not entirely composed of any familiar antecedent such as demon, zombie, or serial killer); a discussion of the film's use of time disruption; and a tour of the different spaces and neighborhoods visited in the film, which take on new significance ""in a film about having room to escape an unstoppable entity.""","The Descent (2005)

Author Thomson follows the film's plot beat by beat, noting where the director's expert touch creates unbearable suspense or shock, and providing observations on the finished product in the context of its time (such as his comment that Marion Crane being clad in just a bra and half-slip ""in the code of 1960 ... is 'naked'""). He also comments on the aspects of Psycho that indelibly mark it a Hitchcock work, such as his virtual torture of its leading actress, who is ""remorselessly studied for forty minutes and then torn to pieces."" He adds nibbles of information along the way about Tony Perkins' bravura performance, Paramount's hand-wringing over the release of the film, attempts at censorship, novel marketing tactics, critical reception, and a short list of other films (indexed below) that Thomson claims are indebted to Psycho.

The Psycho shower scene, Thomson observes, forever changed audience expectations of horror, just at the right time in the midcentury collective consciousness. Whether this ""moment"" was a revelation of our truly violent human nature, or just a new threshhold of filmmaking, is arguable. But unquestionably, Hitchcock proved that ""this medium was prepared for an outrage in which sex and violence were no longer games but were in fact everything.""","The Birds (1963)

His approach is (as he explains) sociological in nature rather than Freudian, as was de rigeur at the time of the book's publication. Tudor thus avoids looking for deep symbolism, and instead asks how the ""practical consciousness"" of the moviegoing public perceived these films. 

The book is based on Tudor's dataset of 990 horror films released from 1931-1984, ending just after the slasher boom (which unfortunately means his review is long out of date). Once he has those films, Tudor is then obsessed with putting them in boxes. He categorizes the type and style of film on multiple axes of his own making, such as whether the horror is ""internal"" (like in Halloween and other psycho killer movies) or ""external"" (like classic monster movies), and whether the central monster is sexual, supernatural, or psychotic in nature. He even includes trend charts based on statistics run from his own categorizations. The result is a bit bloodless, and more than a little reminiscent of that week in English class you spent diagramming sentences.

Yet Monsters and Mad Scientists remains well-known and oft-quoted for a few of its key observations. Primary among them is Tudor's identification of 1960, the year of Psycho, as the dividing line between classic horror of the ""secure"" era (the monster is defeated, social order restored) and the beginning of the ""paranoid"" era (everything is bad, nothing will ever be the same). Tudor's observations as to which types of narratives were more common from decade to decade -- such as the rise of invasion films in the '50s and the increasing proximity of killers to the family unit in the '70s -- are also on-point, and in fact have become standard horror history.","(Note: The book briefly mentions hundreds more films; only those that received some significant commentary are indexed below.)

Romero's zombies as allegories -- for destructive consumption, social conformity, and a host of unhealthy -isms. Paffenroth instead takes a theological view: zombies are what they are because they're plagued with our sins. His Gospel of the Living Dead is loosely framed as a companion to Dante's Inferno, where hell is a torment of own making and sinners of different kinds populate levels of the underworld. Paffenroth takes up just the essential Romero cannon -- Night of the Living Dead (1968) through Land of the Living Dead (2005), plus one remake -- and postulates on the particular sins depicted in each, from pride to materialism to domination. Only in Land of the  Dead, he argues, does Romero finally anticipate humans and zombies expiating their shared sins and rebuilding a more egalitarian society.

The author deliberately intends to moralize here, but the book is hardly preachy -- and, note, it won a Bram Stoker Award. While he does provide a solidly Christian view of religion (Roman Catholic, in particular), he espouses a progressive social viewpoint throughout, for example, by faulting the men in Day of the Dead for their misogyny and racism as much as their sinful violence. Given their similarity to humans, zombies have been a useful figure on which to project any number of our fears and social ills, and Paffenroth shows they are plenty capable of bearing our crises of faith as well.","28 Days Later (2002)

Instead, he intends to let American history do that for us. Monsters in America is first and foremost a book of history -- about the violence, wars, social upheaval, and exploration that make up the very core of what we think of as the United States. Within that very long story are fictional monsters, often human or human-created, that serve as the reification and expiation of very real monsters in American life, from the whip-holding slave owner to communism. Poole intends to address why we cannot simply identify the monster as a metaphor for something that repels or frightens us as individuals -- because we often embrace our monsters at a societal level (or at least are titillated by it), revealing that the monsters are not separable from our own world views, nor do they simply reflect our own idiosyncratic psyches.

Poole has selected his eras with care, and avoids the war-to-war cycle that so many other historians use to make their way through the 17th-21st centuries. He starts with the settling of the country by white Europeans and the nearly instant, violent clash with Native Americans, moving through the post-Civil War years, the Great American Sleep of the 1950s, the 1980s Satanic Panic, the body obsession era of the late 20th century, and the post 9/11 world. In each chapter, Poole picks a few films that encapsulate the monsters of the time, such as Freaks (1932) and Frankenstein (1931), released during a time of unprecedented racist imagery depicting African-Americans and immigrants as monsters and hysteria over racial mixing. Poole has a knack for finding lesser-known corners of the horror world, including the American preoccupation with sea monsters (!) in the early days of the nation and midcentury stories of sexual encounters with aliens, a manifestation of very real societal changes in the acceptance of sexuality.

This is not a feel-good history lesson; racism and social strife come up at every turn. Intentionally so -- the thread going through the entire book is about how violence defines us as Americans and ""how monster tales have been used as exhibitions of power over the oppressed."" 

Monsters in America is far more than the rather lazy search for easy metaphors that you get from so many other writings (yeah, Godzilla is the A-bomb, we get it). Poole is an impecceable researcher and a highly engaging writing, and this is as much a nice brush-up on American history as it is a book about horror. Maybe you and your parents can read the same book for once?  ","28 Days Later (2002)

While some readers may find industrial review saps all the fun out of monster flicks, many will find it refreshing to look at these films from a more practical and less artistic or symbolic perspective.

In Merchants of Menace, Nowell farms out most of the writing to contributors, many of whom are well-known writers on the horror genre. Chapter 11 from Mikal J. Gaines is a particular standout, looking at how the press and audiences in African-American communities responded to horror films in the 1950s-1960s, some of which were blatantly racist and equated blackness with monstrosity, and others appeared to poke fun at such tropes and were marketed directly to minority viewers. Gaines relates ""how black media facilitated a dialog about the movies while being used to sell a product that had rarely been conceived with black spectators in mind."" Also notable is Nowell's own essay (Chapter 8) in which he gives a different kind star treatment to Jamie Lee Curtis, Scream Queen of the early 1980s. Nowell explores how Curtis's status as the repeat lead actress in early '80s slashers was at least in part a business decision, given that her famous lineage and warm personality (at least partially the product of careful branding) helped counteract negative reputation of such films and move them into the fold of mainstream Hollywood.","Edwards, Kyle - Chapter 1: ""House of Horrors"": Corporate Strategy at Universal Pictures in the 1930s

This was based in part on the ""grindhouse"" theaters that lined the blocks off Times Square, grinding out a stream of violence, gore, and nude flesh. While other grindhouse histories do little more than gush about this seamy past, editors Fisher and Walker are more sober-minded. As they point out in the introduction, just because trash is now cool doesn't turn all trash into art. And so they have assembled an impressive roster of contributors to turn a critical eye to the grindhouse aesthetic, or ""paracinema,"" and its cultural significance.

The scope of the book is impressive, reaching into far corners of grindhouse cinema, such as biker films, blaxploitation westerns, and even ""Indiansploitation."" Horror fans, however, will most appreciate three chapters. In Chapter 1, Glenn Ward makes the bold claim that the iconic ""grindhouse"" film is a recent invention (blaming Tarantino and other ""cultists"") and that the 42nd Street mythos is far tamer when viewed with the eyes of history rather than fandom. In Chapter 3, author Brandum tells the history of the infamous Italian cannibal films as experienced by audiences in Melbourne in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Through some painstaking research into local theater marketing, he reveals that Australia had no ""grindhouse"" cultureto speak of, and thus these films were aimed at a suburban, middle-class audience, who experienced these films alongside standard Hollywood fare. Finally, we're back in Oz in Chapter 9, where Alexandra Heller-Nicholas discusses the world of Ozploitation films, including genre-reflective horror flicks such as Dead-End Drive-In and Thirst.","Fisher, Austin and Johnny Walker - Introduction: 42nd Street, and Beyond

Thus the editors present this series of essays about food and eating in the horror film, from Hollywood hits to obscurities (seriously, this may be the only chance you have to witness an academic take on Poultrygeist). Among the best entries: Thomas Prasch's deconstruction of The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover as Thatcherist critique and historical allusion (Ch. 6); Tom Hertweck's examination of cannibalism bringing two women together in Chul-Soo Park's 301/302 (Ch. 8); Erin Wiegand's survey of cannibal-savage movies of the late 1970s and the link between the animal and human deaths depicted within (Ch. 15); and Vivian Halloran's fun history lesson on meat pies as coffins (one for your ""I did not know that!"" file) (Ch. 19).

About half the chapters deal with film, including twin chapters on the garb of Frankenstein (the male monster) and his Bride (the female monster) from authors Jaeb and Lublin. The authors note how the original clothing and hairstyles (er, headstyles?) chosen for both figures in the 1930s films emphasis one's deathly origins but the other's femininity. In Chapter 5, author McKnight tells the history of the Jack the Ripper murders and the prominent role that his victims' class-revealing clothing played in contemporaneous news stories, only to be sensationalized with heaving breasts and tight corsets in later films and fashions. The last three chapters delve into the realm of the slasher, addressing Halloween costuming as a metamorphosing device in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988) (Chapter 9); masks that reveal the personality and motives of the slasher (Chapter 10); and films that invoke the cultural myth of the foolkiller, as used by Edgar Allan Poe in his story ""Hop-Frog"" (Chapter 11).

On a horror-TV note, in Chapter 7, author Lezama notes how the attire of the zombies in The Walking Dead not only marks their abjection but also places them in a social class far apart from men like Dr. Lecter in Hannibal, whose dandyish formality marks him as part of the ""unproductive elite,"" with an elegance that allows him (or urges him?) to kill the bourgeoisie.

While not concerning film, Stephanie Bowry's Chapter 2 has an interesting take on vampires of 20th-century literature, including Anne Rice's Lestat, and how their finery, including the color red and uncanny wedding dresses, become part of their human masquerade through the ages. Wedding dresses come up again in Chapter 4, with author Heaton looking to gothic writers like Wilkie Collins whose texts rely upon the ""ritualized expression of femininity"" in bridal gowns to create white-clad doppelgangers of doom.","Whitehead, Gudrun D. and Julia Petrov - Introduction: Fashion and Fear

Taylor tells you upfront: this book is not about those movies. Instead, it's a love letter to the ""horror movies, biker pictures, nudie teasers, women's prison pictures, moonshiner sagas, phony documentaries...and Eurosleaze exploitation pictures"" that graced the indoor and outdoor screens of America, ignored by critics but gobbled up by those in search of lurid, ""adult"" thrills. Most refreshing is that Taylor does not simply provide a film encyclopedia. Instead, each chapter focuses on a single film, with Taylor providing his take on the film's historical and social context. For Eyes of Laura Mars -- which, really more of a giallo, is the most solidly ""horror"" film highlighted in the book -- Taylor invokes the grime of 1970s New York City and the Rolling Stone's album Some Girls to place the film in the  category of ""sleaze as high chic.""

He rips through the story chronologically and, sadly, with far too light a touch on facts and citations (and far too early to include anything from the contemporary horror era). He begins with Victorian crackdowns on nudie pictures and peep shows, and quickly catches up to Hollywood in 1926 with the Hayes Code. Horror comes onto the scene early, with The Cabinet of Dr Caligari targeted by some U.S. states for ""portarying anarchy"" and Tod Browning's Freaks ""killed worldwide by censorship.""

Her focus is narrow: how does the philosophy of Georges Bataille explain the peculiar constellation of horror and thriller films that filled theaters in the post-WWII era? It would be too blithe to summarize her theory as ""everything is about sex,"" but, well, monsters, body snatchers, vampires, and even teenagers are all about sex. But they are not simply metaphors for intercourse -- instead, they tap into the deep-rooted desires for both love and death that Bataille deemed ""eroticism.""

Each chapter unearths a different aspect of 1950s genre cinema and highlights seminal films. Hendershot takes on both the relatively obscure (such The Alligator People (1959)) and Hollywood blockbusters. For the latter, Hendershot voices clear dissent to popular interpretations that render the films too neat, such as the oft-heard statement that Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) is a rather flat metaphor for McCarthyism. While that is one reading, Hendershot takes the film instead to suggest that love and intimate comforts are the ""means of countering the horror of a conformist society."" Also compelling is her exposé of the shockingly misogynistic mother-blaming trend -- ""Momism"" -- that she ties to monstrous cinematic females.    

I Was a Cold War Monster does far more deep thinking about 1950s monster flicks than most critics have attempted. If there's a flaw here, it's that Hendershot puts out a lot of thoughts in a minimum of pages, so that each chapter's thesis seems a bit rushed and occasionally undersupported. In addition, without a working knowledge of Bataille's theories (which have notes of surrealism, psychoanalysis, and other schools), this may be a difficult read.","The Alligator People (1959)

The authors largely dismiss the oft-heard quip that slashers were merely a conservative political reaction to the free-wheeling 1960s/70s. Instead, they explain how slasher narratives (physical danger, stalking, male predator) and on-screen formal elements (point-of-view shots, focus on fear reactions) tap into our ""evolved psychological machinery"" to avoid physical harm, and are consequently perceived as engaging, arousing, even pleasurable.

In addition, David Andrews provides thoughts on 1970s rape-revenge films and their 21st-century remakes, and what they have to say about free will and the inevitable recourse to evolutionary strategies of behavior.","Clasen, Mathias and Todd K. Platts - Evolution and Slasher Films

Cherry explores the notion that women may enjoy horror films far more than previously reported, or exaggerate their feelings of fear or disgust when watching such films, in order to conform to expected gender norms. Her own research, a survey conducted with female horror fans, supports the idea that some women's love of horror is quite strong, and has simply been undetected.","Kramer, Peter - Chapter 5: A Powerful Cinema-going Force?

Paglia briefly touches upon the production of the film, but most of this slim, but packed, volume is dedicated to a scene-by scene analysis. No detail escapes Paglia's eye or imagination, starting with the opening titles (which, she notes, ""overlap and disintegrate, as if bitten to pieces by invisible beaks""). 

Paglia's personality comes through strongly here, for better or for worse. That means phallic symbols are everywhere, from the heroine's clutch bag to pencils, and the themes of femininity/misogyny, captivity, and domestication are dominant in the film; both birds and women, she declares, are treated in the film as ""a single category of capricious being."" Paglia's style is conversational and uninterrupted by citations, as if she was sitting next to you, live-annotating the film. And while you may not care for her distracting tendency to make literary and film allusions out of sheer coincidences, there is no doubting her genuine love for Hitchcock's filmmaking.","The Bad Seed (1956)

Andrew Tudor -- in a sort of sequel to his 1989 book Monsters and Mad Scientists -- surveys the world of horror of the late 20th century and considers what makes it ""postmodern."" He finds that contemporary horror is still of the ""paranoid"" type, where authorities are helpless against the prevailing monster, which often arises from the bosom of the family. What sets these recent films apart is the deliberate, commercial use of reflexivity -- as in Scream, whose appeal was largely attributed to its delight in its own meta-horror. 

Dan Harries looks at parodic films that mock genres themselves, including horror. In fact, Harries asserts, horror is particularly ripe for parody, given that the genre rests on ""suspense and thwarted expectations.""

Austin Thomas uses Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 vampire epic as a case study in the careful packaging of genre. Through marketing emphasis on the prestige aspects of the picture and the erotic-romantic elements, producers aimed the movie at being as attractive as possible to as many viewers as possible, not just the core horror market, and to differentiate it from prior vampire flicks.","Tudor, Andrew - From Paranoia to Postmodernism?

Famously, the role of Ripley was not written for a woman. But after being cast with Sigourney Weaver, who dedicated herself to the role over the course of four films and almost two decades, the figure of Ripley took on not just the weight of sci-fi stardom but also great interest as a trailblazing female character. Graham's intent is to facilitate an inter-disciplinary discussion of Ripley as woman, at a level suitable for undergraduates. (The volume is, for the most part, as jargon-free as advertised.)

Each of the five chapters takes on a different aspect of Ripley and the question of gender. Chapter 1 is a fine starting point; author Moore maps Ripley from the original Alien onto the advent of second-wave feminism and its radical wing. In Chapter 2, author Wood turns to its sequel Aliens, with a depressingly accurate report on the undoing of Alien's incipient feminism, and the ""sexist ideology that encases"" the second film. Chapter 3 (author Dadlez) analyzes Alien3 in the context of Simon de Beauvoir's feminist manifesto The Second Sex, comparing Ripley to Eve, a destroyer of the male status quo who becomes the ""mediatrix"" of both damnation and salvation. In Chapter 4, authors Bach and Langer catalog the many incidents of sexualized violence in the series and note that, through the series, Ripley gains the ability to defend against such violence as a hybrid creature -- part synthetic/human, part man/woman. Finally, in Chapter 5, author and editor Graham considers whether Ripley has attained the philosophical status of autonomous being, and whether the very concept of autonomy is rigged game in that it is gendered male.

At the back of the book are scene-by-scene recaps of the  Alien quadrilogy films, which, helpfully, show departures from theatrical and special editions, plus a (largely unnecessary) drive-by view of the Predator and Alien v. Predator franchises.","Alien (1979)

It is a personal essay, as author Fraser announces in his introduction, about the meaning of aggression, monsters, and victimhood in popular culture within the psyche of the post-WWII population that had just learned a harsh lesson of what violence is. 

The book is segregated roughly into sections: ""Ambivalences,"" in which Fraser considers what violence we adore and what violence we abhor; ""Revolt,"" regarding the politics of violence; Victims; and Violators. Fraser fluidly moves through a remarkable range of references, from the Marquis de Sade to Herschell Gordon Lewis to Shakespeare, and he finds connections that even those who are well-read may not have noticed. 

Fraser addresses horror only occasionally, most notably in the section regarding ""Violators."" He notes the symbolic importance of a new breed of horror villains, such as Dr. Genessier of Les yeux sans visage, who show bottomless capacity for evil, yet are not deformed by it as they may have been in the classic horror era. Instead, ""they are capable of functioning perfectly successfully in normal society"" -- reminiscent of Nazis, the Manson clan, and any number of modern antagonists.

In a sea of heavily footnoted, clinical dissections of popular culture, Fraser's personal and conversational approach is refreshing. While his references are stuck in a midcentury framework, Violence in the Arts remains oft-quoted and a meaningful work even for contemporary audiences.","Blood Feast (1963)

She looks closely at The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, a study in past-present contrasts. The film is carefully imbued with a look of documentary-style realism, but that realism is entirely fake. It also incorporates elements of the Western genre, but transports the viewer from an idyllic, lightly sun-toasted version of Texas to the post-Vietnam version, in which the entire film acts as a ""physical, aural, and visual attack on the viewer."" (Dika also suggests that Texas Chain Saw intentionally hearkens back to Psycho as its ur-text, which is arguably little more then genre-coincidence.) 

Later, Dika addresses the ""stalker film"" (e.g., Halloween) which she claims ""owes more to the science fiction films of the 1950s and to the Western than it does to Psycho."" On this point, she analyzes Scream and its self-reflexive attitude, as well as Gus van Sant's remake of Psycho.

A worthy goal, given the volume and outsized influence of writers coming at horror genre from a psychoanalytic direction since the 1970s -- Mulvey, Creed, Clover, Williams, and more.

The foreword, written by renowned movie critic and self-described Marxist Robin Wood, is an important starting point. Wood explains that for himself and his contemporaries, horror movies were important because their ideas were important. Their nihilism and progressiveness laid bare social ills and repressive mores. Psychoanalysis, Wood writes, ""was a valuable weapon that could be used politically.""

This volume is intensely academic, so fair warning that it's likely most enjoyed by those of the same bent. Most accessible are: Schneider's essay (Chapter 6), in which he creates a taxonomy of the ""cinematic double,"" even if he was rude enough to invite author Cynthia Freeland to contribute a similar theory in Chapter 5 and then proceed to pick it apart; Harvey Roy Greenberg's essay regarding the ""rehabilitation"" of monsters in film through comedy, proximity to children, and general sympathy (Chapter 7); the always-entertaining Barbara Creed with her fantasy of Freud contemplating modern horror cinema, and in particular, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Chapter 11); and Linda Badley's examination of the horror director as auteur (Chapter 13).","Wood, Robin - Foreword: ""What Lies Beneath?""

In 1967, no ""serious"" writers wrote about the horror genre, nor was it considered historically relevant - in fact, as Clarens notes, ""horror movies have been called all kinds of names, running from incitement to crime to psychopathy of the masses."" Here, Clarens reclaims horror as worthy: ""Fantastic art, of which horror films and science fiction are the popoular champions, makes us realize that man carries in himself an instinct for destruction, but also the will to curb this instinct.""

Clarens's book takes readers from the earliest days of silent horror films through the mid-1960s, and he includes films in the fantastic and sci-fi genres. Essentially a filmography with commentary, Clarens writes fluidly from film to film in roughly chronological order, offering historical notes, critical readings, and frank, often entertaining opinions (such as his take on I Was a Teenage Frankenstein as ""inspiredly absurd"" and his dis of Roger Corman's Masque of the Red Death as having ""all the flat undimensioned elegance of a well-drawn comic strip""). He also shows an international reach uncharacteristic for a midcentury writer, for example, lauding the 1963 Czech film Ikarie XB1 and highlighting Mexico's horror tradition.

Note, however, that it is a tad misleading to call this an ""illustrated"" guide - aside from a few pages of black-and-white photos in the first and last pages, there are no illustrations. An index of the films, plus cast and credits, are included in the back.","(Note: Only those films receiving significant commentary are indexed below.)

Fans could hardly want a fiercer defense of Brian De Palma's Carrie, the director's ""first fully sustained masterpiece of theme as style…an allusive postmodern nightmare and a universal fairy tale about growing up different."" Author Aisenberg provides background to the film, from Carrie White's genesis in Stephen King's 1973 novel (and all the gender-based conflict its writing may or may not have created in King's psyche), casting, and production. He then moves to a deep, textual read, liberally interwoven with screenplay notes, DVD commentary, and interviews to explain scenes and camera shots. His attention to detail helps brings alive certain aspects of the movie one might have overlooked, such as the brief moment in which Carrie is locked inside the prayer closet by her mother and contemplates a creepy crucifixation statue, which, we learn, was conceived of by De Palma and realized in painstaking detail by art director Fisk (and presages Margaret White's death scene). 

Aisenberg's approach is more about film-making than larger ideas of the film's interpretation, but as a textual guide, it's arguably definitive. As a bonus, the author incudes his own 2009 interview with De Palma which, unfortunately, contains more of Aisenberg's thoughts than  De Palma's (at one point, he tells Aisenberg ""You know more about this than I do""), and another interview with screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen.","The Birds (1963)

Most of these films would today be considered thrillers or film noir, although were often marketed as horror.

The volume begins with a charming yet discomforting essay by actress Evelyn Ankers (Gwen in The Wolf Man, and many other films). She breezes through stories of her career in horror films, incuding having to hide her pregnancy, endure crew insults, and fight off attempted sexual assault, with the light tone of one recalling memories of a summer picnic. While one applauds her resiliency, by getting this sort of insight into the real world of 1940s Hollywood, one also might wonder what was so ""golden"" about this age after all.","Bewitched (1945)

Many of the details have been recited elsewhere (the heat, the smell, the animal parts strewn everywhere), but getting Hansen's personal account is invaluable. With a refreshingly ego-free writing style, he freely reminiscences about interactions with the cast and the tin-can-and-a-shoestring production, e.g., his confession that they used a working chain saw during the infamous scene in which Leatherface chops up character Kirk; actor Bill Vail says ""I could feel splinters hitting me, I could feel the hot oil coming off the blade..."". Also compelling is Hansen's discussion of Leatherface's psyche and sexuality, and his account of the money squabbles that arose after the film wrapped, thanks to a mobbed-up distributor. In the end, the book reveals that Hansen is an undercover Rennaissance man, and serves as a fine tribute.",The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974),"Leatherface, Tobe Hooper, production, memoirs",Yes,

Those familiar with Wood understand that he is not a critic in the style of Roger Ebert or Pauline Kael; he examines films not only for their entertainment value and contributions to film as an art form, but also for their political consciousness. Specifically, this means declaring whether a film is on the correct side of Wood's strict leftist-Marxist-Freudian-feminist-bisexual outlook, one far more radical than 21st century readers are accustomed to seeing in mainstream movie critique. 

Wood famously had a soft spot for horror because he believed that the genre was particularly conducive to rooting out regressive tendencies and displaying the evils of late capitalist, patriarchal society. His essay included here as Chapter 5, ""The American Nightmare: Horror in the 70s,"" is his seminal piece on the topic. He is an unabashed fan of George A. Romero's and Larry Cohen's films (Chapter 6, 14) and perpetually conflicted about Brian De Palma's (Chapter 7). In the latter, Wood lauds Sisters (1972) for being one of the preeminent movies of the 1970s, but works through discomfort over the director's treatment of women in others. In Chapters 8 and 9, he cannot disguise his disgust at the evolving state of Hollywood in the early 1980s. He bemoans the ""false, manufactured optimism"" of the time and the popularity of return-to-childhood fare -- including the massively popular Star Wars series, E.T., and slashers -- and dismisses the entire age as a massive step backward in terms of both politics and cinema.","(Note: Chapters marked with an asterisk are present in both the 1986 and 2003 editions; chapters with marked are present only in the 2003 edition.)

More accurate to say the book is about horror and comedy, two genres whose attractiveness often lies in their vulgarity. 

In his first several (rather dry) chapters, Paul addresses ""gross out"" entertainment from an art history perspective, arguing that vulgarity serves an important cultural function as an expression of liberation that cannot be contained by morality or even reality -- like riding on a roller coaster, which prompts both laughs and screams. This is precisely why certain ""beats"" of comedy are recognizable in horror films, and vice versa (think of the final shock scene A Nightmare on Elm Street). 

Paul locates the vulgarity in horror in several respects. Blood and guts, of course -- but it must be gratuitous to be vulgar. He also examines the use of children in horror films as victims or monsters, which precedes the corruption of families (Night of the Living Dead, The Bad Seed, The Exorcist). As Paul points out, the increased ""gross physicality"" of horror in the 1970s led to the body itself becoming a locus of vulgarity, such as in Carrie (soaked in both menstral and pig's blood), The Brood (in which the antagonist literally turns herself inside out), and Alien.","Alien (1979)

First, she challenges the common view of the horror film as enforcing traditional sexuality and gender roles, both in the characters and spectators. Monsters are fluid, she notes. Even if coded as male/female, monsters are not truly men/women or heterosexual; think of Count Dracula's inhumanity and his homoerotic effect on Jonathan Harker. That fluidity gives permission to spectators, too, to enjoy the slide into what the author calls ""drag."" Berenstein also challenges the notion that female victims in ""hypnosis"" monster films (Dracula et al) is solely an exercise in women's masochism; explores the homoerotic and homosocial properties of mad-doctor movies; and unpacks the role of white females in ""jungle films"" such as King Kong. 

This is a truly academic work, stemming from Berenstein's PhD thesis. So there's a lot of inside-baseball here, and you'll get more out this text if you first bone up on the seminal texts by Carroll, Mulvey, Twitchell, and Clover around which Berenstein structures her arguments.","The Black Cat (1934)

In Shocking Representation, he draws upon trauma studies as well as art and film theory to explore the culturally relevant connection between trauma, mourning, and some of our most important horror fictions.

Lowenstein's thesis takes him on a trip around the world and through several decades of the 20th and 21st centuries. World War II, however, is the dominant theme. He interprets Georges Franju's Eyes Without a Face (Les Yeux Sans Visage) (1960) as a film heavy with French guilt over the WWII Vichy occupation era and the war in Algeria. As for England, he looks to Peeping Tom (1960) as a reflection of the breakdown of class boundaries after WWII, hailed as ""The People's War,"" but whose unifying nature could not be sustained in the decades after. Moving to Japan, the author reads Onibaba (1964) as an allegory for the Hiroshima bombing and war victimhood, tied up in the figure of haunted women. 

The chapter on Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left (1972) moves to a different war, different era: Vietnam. As Lowenstein demonstrates, the film confronts the divisiveness of the era, in which American society learned to take sides by demonizing the opposition -- young/old, hippie/conservative, blue collar/white collar -- crystallized into both jungle combat and home-grown violent tragedies like the Kent State shooting. 

Lowenstein wraps up with a chapter on David Cronenberg, whose films literalize the fractured nature of national (specifically, Canadian) identity through fractured bodies, and a brief final note on 9/11.

While Lowenstein is an engaging writer, the concepts he draws from -- grounded in philosophy, psychoanalysis, history, and film theory -- are difficult to grasp with a mere breezy read. The book is also bursting at the seams with historical references and primary sources. As one of the best books available linking horror to history, it may be worth multiple reads.

The ravages of war, some say. Ancient myths, others say. Smith has a different idea: that the monsters of early horror cinema looked the way they did and got the reactions that they did, at least in part, because of an early concept of body horror: the fear of disability. The driving force of the eugenics movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was to identify and support the genetically superior while diagnosing and suppressing - if not outright killing - the genetically inferior. When the broken and grotesque Frankenstein's monster towered over the body of the young white girl, or Dracula appears in Lucy's bedchamber as a bat intending to mix their blood, he is precisely the type of degenerate ""Other"" that politicians and moralizers warned those girls against marrying. And ironically, these films about degenerates often became shunned themselves as degenerate films (think Freaks).

Smith makes a good case that physical disability has been overlooked as one of the ""differences"" encoded in the dread of horror. Her academic tone is sometimes a bit of a sludge, but her thesis is unique and worth the read.","Bride of Frankenstein (1935)

Each chapter examines one facet of the torture debate, often through the lens of pop culture. 

Be forewarned, however, this book is far more about history, politics, and morality than it is about horror, and there is no in-depth discussion of so-called ""torture porn"" of Hostel or Saw.

(Justin) Kerswell, who keeps up the Hysteria Lives website, with its exhaustive series of slasher reviews and bonus content, and its companion, the long-running podcast (and Horror Lex favorite) Hysteria Continues. This book is the breezy, colorful, coffee-table version of the slasher encyclopedia that Kerswell could write. The book gives a basic overview of slasher movie origins, gialli, the late '70s-early '80s boom and then rapid bust, the undying sequels and remakes, and the subgenre's revival via Scream and beyond. It's a basic education for those not well-versed in slashers, and a trophy book for those who are.","(Note: Many more films are mentioned in passing; the ones below get at least a sentence or two.)

Continuum, 2011.",,,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Blood_Money/W1LKBAAAQBAJ?kptab=overview,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10504978-blood-money,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755872044,"Refreshingly, Blood Money is not a review book or a nostalgia piece, but a historical record of a well-loved and much-misunderstood film era: the teen slasher boom of the late '70s to early '80s. Author Nowell examines this not from an artistic perspective, but as a business phenomenon, through production, distribution, and promotion by the major Hollywood studios and indies. Along the way, he provides (in his words) a new model of film cycle development, from the Pioneer Production (Black Christmas) to Carpetbagger Cash-Ins (Happy Birthday To Me, Graduation Day, et al). 

While his diagrammatical approach to the structure of the slasher era is perhaps needlessly literal, Nowell truly shines when offering observations about the subgenre that buck decades of conventional wisdom. Hollywood tastemakers, he posits, “actually went to extraordinary lengths to make early teen slashers attractive to female youth, to minimize displays of violence, gore, and suffering, and to invite comparisons to a wide range of post-classical Hollywood’s biggest hits....” In fact, many slashers could better be described as “female-centered animal comedy-infused murder-mysteries,” with the intent of garnering the allowance money of the same young women (and their dates) who went to see Saturday Night Fever. Nowell ably supports his thesis with a special examination of Halloween and Friday the 13th, both big hits, taking different paths; Prom Night, a Canadian film built to break into the U.S. market; and the ""Group of 11"" slashers from 1981 that signaled oversupply and a (temporary) end of the trend. 

Surprises abound in the book, such as Nowell's provocative opinion that Black Christmas owes more to Magnum Force than any proto-slasher like Psycho; his proof that Halloween's financial success is overblown; and a fun comparison of movie posters, showing how one film evoked another with simple images. While Nowell's book can be faulted for its density and repetition, slasher fans should feel free to treat it like a Bible. ","Alien (1979)

Her thesis is that whereas teen flicks of the '50s and '60s were unremittingly ""straight"" -- with narratives that steered teens headlong into ""compliant, gendered, heterosexual, middle class"" society -- films of the '70s provided a limited reprieve. During our late mid-century American ""crisis of confidence,"" teens on screen were allowed to challenge moral and gender norms as well as show a ""chilling disregard for the authority of parents, or more specifically patriarchal, culture."" 

Brickman examines this trend in different strains of 1970s films that either depicted or were marketed toward teenagers: the high-school-centered movie, either in fact (Grease) or in spirit (The Rocky Horror Picture Show); coming-of-age films (Badlands, American Graffitti); works reflecting a new appreciation of ""the queer kid"" (An American Family, Ode to Billy Joe); the films of Jodie Foster, Disney's wholesome androgyne (Freaky Friday); and teen slashers (Halloween). 

In this final chapter (""Brothers, Sisters, and Chainsaws: Sibling Rivalry and Peer Centrality in the Teen Slasher Film""), Brickman examines the relationship between siblings in slashers. Speaking from a primarily psychoanalytic viewpoint, Brickman asserts that slashers depict a clash of adolescents -- the sexually stunted boogeyman versus the adrogynous Final Girl -- which reflects a lateral, ""sibling rivalry"" rather than a rift between generations. This theme, Brickman argues, shows up in the Sally/Franklin and Sawyer Family strife of Texas Chain Saw Massacre and the sororicidal Michael Myers and his sister-target, Laurie Strode. Given that one's sibling is essentially a replacement (the same genetic package in another's body), these films reflect a repressed ""desire to kill the other whose existence threatens to annihilate you,"" which, at the same time, threatens murder of the self.","Carrie (1976)

Horror cinema, he offers, is an art form that has absorbed that trauma and reflects it back. Sometimes this is quite literal, as with the spate of post-9/11 New-York-destruction films in which planes crash, bodies fall from buildings, and the camera shakes as everyone, even the camera operator, runs away from danger (Cloverfield, War of the Worlds). 

Other scars can be traced in more subtle ways, Wetmore notes. After 9/11, horror movie deaths become more random and endings much bleaker, reflecting our inability to stop the carnage; see The Mist, in which no amount of stockpiling dog food against the grocery store windows was enough to keep people safe. Ghosts and vampires became more malevolent, and a new preoccupation with religious fundamentalism brought on a new wave of exorcism films, in which demons are real and must be fought. The same happened to zombies, who brought on apocalypses that politicians and even the military were incapable of stopping. Revenge in the form of torture became fully justified (Hostel, I Spit on Your Grave (2010)). 

Finally, Wetmore notes the many remakes of '80s slashers that populated screens in the 2000s, which he believes can be at least partially explained by nostalgia for an earlier time, when America was strong and a killer's rationale could be summed up with one word: ""evil."" A well-organized and thoughtful book.","28 Days Later (2002)

Both soldiers and the civilian wartime homefront were covered in ""viscera, mud, and blood"" and involuntarily confronted with ""millions of corpses that could not be buried."" Poison gas, mutilations, mass death; these horrors became known even to the privileged and previously optimistic. Enter the bloodsuckers and the living dead, who found willing audiences with a new-found fascination with body horror.

Poole surveys the biggest horror film hits of the '20s and '30s, along with rarer European cuts, to make his case, and includes well-researched accounts of the personal relationships between individual artists of the time -- actors, directors, writers, painters -- and the war. Most enlightening is Poole's distinction between the postwar, deeply traumitized Europeans on the road to Nazism (who gravitated toward the dark and authoritarian; Caligari) and the cheerfully deluded Americans (who preferred to ""mix scares and giggles"").

With that, Peary, a film critic and writer with an unparalleled reputation for spotting diamonds in the rough, offers his first collection of recommended cult films -- those that appeal not to the masses, he explains, but to a minority of devotees, and on a pedigree of plots, dialogue, and characters outside the Hollywood mainstream. (You may quibble with this definition, given Peary's selections; Citizen Kane and Casablanca are both here.) 

In this volume, Peary highlights 105 films, a portion of which can be considered fully or partially within the horror genre. For each, he provides basic film facts, a thorough synopsis, and an essay commenting on its place in film history. Peary's style is conversational and anti-academic, but he is supremely well-informed on film and pulls no punches (e.g., ""The Brood is...Cronenberg's one good film."")

Kane had thus started scratching an itch many fans didn't even know they had. 

VideoScope's popularity spawned this reference guide, which contains brief reviews of over 1,000 films in the genres of action, horror, sci fi, mystery, cult, westerns, and more. In the back of the book, Kane also includes information on the video label availability of each title, plus mail-order and other specialty video suppliers.

Russo, a writer/director/producer known for several hits (Night of the Living Dead) and misses (The Majorettes) gives his best advice, albeit about an indie scene that no longer exists. 

The book is most enlightening for Russo's trivia-laden asides on which films really nailed either a ""do"" or ""don't"" in terms of good filmmaking, such as the chapters in which he painstakingly teases out every element of his screenplay for Voodoo Dawn (1990). Romero fans will also appreciate the detailed tidbits on Night of the Living Dead (which Russo wrote). The big drawback, of course, is that by the end of the book, you've probably learned far more about Russo's career than your own.

In the back of the book, Russo presents interviews from five influential members of the horror filmmaking world -- Wes Craven, Clive Barker, Joe Dante, John Landis, and Rick Baker -- who talk about their craft and biggest films.","Alien (1979)

Halloween (1978) -- ""a truly iconic film"" -- is lovingly detailed and identified as the true root of the slasher boom then to come, notwithstanding the earlier influence of Psycho. Most notable, however, is Skal's attention to Halloween II and the alleged link between that film and two real-life murders in California, which resulted in a showing of the film in court, ""the first time in U.S. legal history that a commercial motion picture had been submitted as evidence at a murder trial."" Skal bravely marches through the remaining sequels, remarking upon The Shape's transformation from phantom menace to ""perverse Christ figure"" and intelligently replying to accusations of misogyny. A fresh take on the entire series.","Halloween (1978)

Sometimes the difference between the monstrous and the normal is only skin deep -- the metaphor that the author has based this book upon.

It is difficult to describe what Skin Shows is ""about,"" given Halberstam's elliptical style and generous use of academic and cultural references. In brief, Halberstam uses a small selection of literary and cinematic works to explore how our culture makes a monster, wrapped up with all our notions of race, nationality, gender, religion, and sexuality that render the monster a ""meaning machine."" Horror movies, by moving the monster front-and-center, disrupt the dominant culture's boundaries.

Halberstam highlights one major work per chapter, starting with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, which is more about the construction of humans than of monsters, and Bram Stoker's Dracula, in which the author reads the titular vampire as a multifactorial Other -- a pan-gendered, pan-sexual Jew. She considers two tales of gothic doubling and buried sexuality, Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray and Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Film is the focus of the final three chapters. She finds an arguable feminist psychoanalytic reading of Hitchcock's The Birds (1963), a gender-subversive and queer hero (Stretch) in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), and a literal skin job in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), where Buffalo Bill's ""fragmented and fragile masculinity"" and Dr. Lecter's evil psychology are two sides of the same monstrous coin.","The Birds (1963)

As Heffernan relates, legal, technological, and sociological changes in the postwar years, not the least of which was the boom in home television ownership and color film, forever changed the production and reception of horror films. Ghouls, Gimmicks, and Gold celebrates the vibrancy and achievement in films of this period, including their increasing psychological complexity, stylization, and exhibitionism, and the cultural changes in the society watching them.

Each chapter addresses a different facet of horror in the post-war period, including the technological race of the early 1950s and advent of 3-D (Chapter 1); the rise of Hammer Studios and American International Pictures (Chapters 2, 5); and Peeping Tom (1960) and other perceived ""art house"" and European fare (Chapters 5, 6). Most intriguing are the chapters in which Heffernan gets into less well-known niches. In Chapter 3, he describes the advent of sensationalistic marketing practices such as attention-grabbing slogans, vivd poster art, and even in-theater stagings which helped sell films like The Hypnotic Eye (1960) to a younger, more downscale generation and fill screens after the downturn in major studio productions. 

Heffernan ends the book with the 1968 rise of ""adult horror"" in Rosemary's Baby and Night of the Living Dead. The former played on old ""female Gothic"" themes of earlier pictures but ramped up the complexity, profanity, and explicit topics such as abortion. The latter, of course, brought a new bleakness and intense violence, and heightened understanding of the African-American theater market and social segregation. 

As appendices, he includes a list of feature film packages for TV syndication, the subject of Chapter 7.","The Bad Seed (1956)

Newitz poses three categories. First are serial killers and mad doctors (the category of ""mental monstrosity"") who see murder as their creation, their jobs. They've gone insane because ""they lead lives which they perceive as forced on them by profit-driven institutions"" -- see Jerry in The Stepfather, whose American Dream demands the perfect family, even if he has to kill to get it -- or in a desperate attempt to keep the economic status that their brains afford them, even if their bodies revolt (as in Re-Animator). Second, she takes up the undead (""bodily monstrosity""), beings that are ""disfigured by the very economic practices which grant them immortality and superhuman powers."" Here, she notes how monsters such as zombies and robots reflect the ""othering"" that justified slavery and oppression of racial minorities, something that has been quite openly depicted in certain horror films (e.g., Nightbreed). Finally, there is the ""narrative monstrosity"" of films like Videodrome and The Ring in which the monster lives in our consumption of mass media and other arms of the capitalist machine. 

Newitz's book is chock-full of references to real-world events and various economic theories, from capitalism to Marxism, as well as literary works, including an extended segment on Lovecraft.","A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)

In Goth: Undead Subculture, editors Goodlad and Bibby attempt a comprehensive, academic discussion of the goth subculture, covering the psychology and motivations of its adherents, as well as their society and norms, fashion, music, and art. 

Contributors have penned essays examining goth subculture from a variety of disciplines, mostly focused on the practical experience of being goth. This includes Kristen Schilt's essay (""Queens of the Damned"") in which she describes the behavior and aesthetics of men and women at different U.S. goth clubs, and Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock's tour through ""Gothic Fetishism."" Others focus on artists and artistic styles that have inspired goths, and in turn, been inspired by them, such as Michael Bibby's chapter (""Atrocity Exhibitions"") on the brief career of Joy Division, a goth godfather band. Many contributors also share their personal experiences as a goth.

Film is a minor focus of this collection. In the editors' introduction, they note the appearance of goth style and goth heroes in mainstream Hollywood films such as Beetlejuice, from the de facto goth Pied Piper, Tim Burton, and The Matrix, ""in which goth style is deployed to represent authentic opposition"" to the status quo. Burton comes up again in  Robert Markley's chapter on Edward Scissorhands (""Geek/Goth""). Vampire cinema is compared against Stoker's classic novel in Nancy Gagnier's essay ""The Authentic Dracula."" In addition, while not about the film, Lauren Stasiak provides a chapter about horror-lite favorite TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (""When You Kiss Me, I Want to Die"").","Goodlad, Lauren M.E. and Michael Bibby - Introduction

Essays relevant to the horror genre are: Colin Gunckel's revelation of the little-known Mexican mummy subgenre, in which the country's Aztec past is mined for horror; Kevin Heffernan's history of Mario Bava's Lisa and the Devil (1972), an example of a film deemed ""bad art"" that was redeemed with the benefit of time and greater appreciation of the lowbrow sensibility; a close listen to the musical scoring of Italian ""video nasties,"" by Kay Dickinson; and Matt Hills' game attempt to defend the Friday the 13th series against the opinion that it is ""mainstream trash"" rather than ""art trash.""

As Wojcik describes, apartments are urban, temporary, and thin-walled; they can serve as voyeuristic playgrounds or claustrophobic traps. On the subject of apartments in horror films, see Veronica Fitzpatrick's chapter on Roman Polanski's Repulsion, a ""domestic horror"" film in which the apartment of central character Carol ""works to formally surface an as-yet-submerged encounter with past sexual trauma.""","Wojcik, Pamela Robertson - Introduction: What Makes the Apartment Complex?

Horror comes up briefly in several chapters: Chapter 7, centering on Finnish-Laplander filmmaker Tommy Wirkola and his horror-parody spins on American films, including 2009's Dead Snow, a ""Nazi-zombie-horror-splatter-comedy""; Chapter 11, which notes the thematic similarities between Arctic landscapes and Cold War tensions and discusses films in which these concepts collide, including the original version of The Thing; and Chapter 12, which touches on Iceland as a ""beautiful, sublime, and fantastical"" shooting location for major Hollywood films, including Prometheus (2012), in which the country stands in for prehistoric Earth. 

In terms of horror, Chapter 13 is the main event. Author Henlin-Strømme explains the concept of ""white nature,"" her name for Norwegian machismo, a tradition stemming from ""snow, ice and white men conquering remote regions in harsh conditions."" In recent Norwegian horror films, white nature is not triumphant but horrific, in the form of a serial killer (Cold Prey) or the living dead (Dead Snow).","Iversen, Gunnar - Chapter 7: Arctic Carnivalesque: Ethnicity, Gender and Transnationality in the Films of Tommy Wirkola

But do not mistake this for a hagiography. Bernard offers more than a healthy dose of skepticism about this group. His main thesis is that while marketed as outsiders who produced ""art"" of a novel and brave kind, the Splat Pack were solidly located within the Hollywood distribution and promotion machine, the same one that facilitated a similar rise of arty horror in the 1920s/1930s and 1970s.

Bernard's book is less about the movies themselves (although the last few chapters do get into textual analyses) and more about the business. In the first several chapters, he reviews the history of indie-major partnerships, the ratings system, and home video viewership. He ends up post-2000, when ""special edition""  and unrated DVDs ""transformed once marginal horror movies into mainstream 'art' for collectors."" Bernard warns that we're all being played and that certain production companies, especially Lionsgate, have deliberately orchestrated their home video product to allow the industry more control over the film marketplace. 

After that, things get personal. Bernard performs a truly brutal take-down of Eli Roth's self-promoting ""hucksterism,"" accusing the director of manufacturing a political agenda to sell Hostel Part 2 and faking subversion while practicing regression. He is kinder to Rob Zombie, whose films can be seen as progressive in that they ""champion the whitetrash underclass and offer no redemption of the middle class,"" although Bernard notes the latter is exactly to whom Zombie promotes his DVDs. Bernard contrasts these two grandstanders with the makers of the Saw series, who offer no ""authorial voice"" but rather offer an elaborate puzzle game mythos and ""digital theme park"" to sell videos.","Cabin Fever (2002)

Gallery Books, 2010.","https://archive.org/details/stephenkingsdans00king_0 [Internet Archive Lending Library, 1981 ed.]",,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Danse_Macabre/Rs1WbPRa3LoC?hl=en&gbpv=0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7652593-danse-macabre,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1011469880,"Danse Macabre remains one of the most influential non-fiction books on the horror genre since its publication in 1981. The author, horror-fiction powerhouse Stephen King, is unquestionably the biggest reason why. Although the book was updated with a new King essay in the 2010 version (""What's Scary?"") the core book is showing its age -- the obscure Boomer nostalgia references often land with a thud, and the lengthy piece on radio horror seems practically alien at this point. But any horror lover would do well to be familiar with it.

Danse Macabre has indeed contributed to the study of horror, in film, literature, and television. King's distinctions between terror, horror, and revulsion, as well as ""Dionysion"" horror vs. ""Apollonian,"" are widely quoted. He also touches on some of the more academic aspects of the study of horror, including the ""paradox of horror"" (i.e., why do people enjoy terrifying things) and psychoanalytic concepts of reintegration and catharsis. On the more populist side, his steadfast defense of bad horror movies -- a not yet ""cool"" opinion in the pre-irony age of 1981 -- is a nice gift for fans.

The book, alas, lets King run too wild. This is early '80s Stephen King: a rising star with Hollywood deals, a legendary ego, and evidently no one to rein in his nonlinear thinking. The meandering and detour-laden style (from Frankenstein to James Dean to obese people...where were we again?) is often frustrating. And while he does claim that someone asked him for this book -- his editor! -- no one was asking for his frequent denigration of other artists' works (Wes Craven, for one) or his often head-scratching personal tastes to be elevated to fact, such as his gushing ode to the 2009 Last on the House Left remake as one of the best modern horror films, while dismissing Cruising (1980) as  ""cheesy."" 

King is much more in control when discussing horror novels, but here, too, he gets lost in his own personal fascinations. One could almost have read Peter Straub's Ghost Story or Anne Rivers Siddons's The House Next Door in the time that King takes to detail their characters and plots, and if you haven't read them, King is pleased to leave you in his dust.

Ultimately, Danse Macabre is at its best when it speaks to what its author does best: write horror novels. King does not frequently promote his own works here, but the few tidbits he provides on the writing of Carrie and the inspiration for The Stand are like diamonds. More important, in discussing what makes the creators and audiences of horror fiction tick, he ultimately tells us what makes him tick. For even casual fans of King, that knowledge is worthwhile.","1408 (2007)

In more recent decades, horror has seen an explosive increase in international production. Fear Without Frontiers aims to introduce those already grounded in the basics of the Anglo-American horror tradition to new cultures, stories, and talent.

The book is well-stacked (over 300 pages) with a good variety of chapters. Readers who have already dipped a toe into European horror cinema will likely enjoy the chapters on giallos and Paul Naschy. J-horror gets its own section, with chapters on director Takashi Miike and some of the better-known film series, like Ringu. But the real value of this book lies in the chapters on more obscure corners of the horror globe. André Barcinski writes about director José Mojica Marins, featuring his Coffin Joe character, which brought an unprecedented level of violence and Catholic heresy to midcentury Brazil. Gary D. Rhodes provides a characteristically well-written chapter on foundational Mexican horror cinema of the 1930s, well before the better-known El Santo and Mexican wrestling came to the screen. Pete Tombs also gives a solid overview of India's Bollywood horror, including foundational films and the decades of output from the Ramsay Brothers.","Keesey, Pam - Madmen, visionaries and freaks: the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky

Author Russell defends the often marginalized zombie subgenre -- ""the great unwashed of horror cinema"" -- that can boast no highbrow literary history. He writes a comprehensive Bible of zombies on film, covering the Caribbean origins; '50s paranoia; Romero's seminal Night of the Living Dead and the rest of his ouevre; the Italian splatter flicks and Spanish ""Blind Dead"" series; Sam Raimi's Evil Dead; Resident Evil and other undead-based video games; and finally, the post-9/11 explosion of zombie fears, beaming into every household via The Walking Dead. 

Russell's research digs deep, including from primary sources, and he analyzes all the major films front, back, and sideways. Particularly sharp is Russell's convincing ability to bring movies into the zombie subgenre that do not fit the traditional mold, such as Shivers. At the back of the book, there is an exclusive interview with George Romero in which he looks back at the genre that he made nearly single-handedly. You'll also find an exhaustive encyclopedia of zombie movies with just enough description to decide if the film is for you. 

Hard to imagine a more complete rundown of the topic, and the 2014 revision substantially added to the text.","13 Eerie (2013)

(The only thing the book misses is the 2009 remake -- which shows you how long it's been since we've had a proper Friday.) Grove's book beat Peter Bracke's similar Crystal Lake Memories (see separate listing on Horror Lex) by just a year, and to that point, Grove had gotten unprecedented access to the creative teams and business personnel responsible for one of the biggest franchises of the 1980s. The sheer amount of interview work represented here is staggering.

The result is, in one sense, a typical ""making of"" book -- each film gets one or two chapters with information on the story development and preproduction, casting, filming, and box office scores. There is too much padding in terms of recounting plot details and dense listings of prior and subsequent credits for the actors. But Grove's interviews provide detail that you simply can't get from IMDB, such as Tom Savini relishing the creation of Jason's would-be death in Part IV, and Kane Hodder talking about his disappointment in not reprising the Jason role after Jason X. Every alternative ending and continuity snafu is covered. The book also tries to be coffee-table-worthy in terms of publishing quality - and while it doesn't quite get there, it is fully decked out with (small) film stills, behind-the-scenes photos, and marketing materials, with a section in the middle in full color.

For Friday the 13th fans, this is a no-brainer buy.","A Bay of Blood (a.k.a. Twitch of the Death Nerve) (1971)

It's huge, it's heavy, it's stocked with interviews, reviews, photos, and posters. It's perhaps a bit... much. But for those obsessed with the obscure, especially of the 1970s-1980s variety, this is both a key sourcebook and hours of entertainment.

Thrower starts with an essay that attempts to capture what it means to be an ""independent"" horror or exploitation film and sketch a history of the decades' most notable entries. The sheer weirdness of these films, he concludes, is ""a combination of accident and artistic ambition,"" given that most were made by nonprofessionals on borrowed money, a cheap camera, and just enough friends willing to put on a rubber mask or stage blood. He notes that indie films of the period bear enviable ""cultural plurality"" given the favorable economic conditions and because the geography of U.S. made it possible to create very different movies in different corners of nation. Thrower also highlights certain subgenres that took hold with audiences, such as slashers, near-pornos, and all variety of monster flicks, and gives solid recommendations for the best in each category.

Thrower then launches into a series of chapters, each highlighting a notable film or filmmaker, and almost all including original interviews. Gems here include Chapter 4, on the New Jersey production of The Deadly Spawn (1983), featuring a legendary monster puppet, ""a triumph of low-budget dedication and design""; Chapter 20, featuring the films of Norman Thaddeus Vane (The Black Room, Frightmare a.k.a. The Horror Star, and Midnight), all of which you're going to want to see immediately; and Chapter 23, which chronicles the production of arguably the most WTF indie horror of all time, Death Bed: The Bed That Eats (1977). 

Throwing light on individual films in-depth is a great way of going about this kind of book; it would be so easy to get lost in an encyclopedia-style death march through every film. If comprehensiveness is what you crave, however, he wraps up with a handy review section containing over 100 films.","(Note: Only those films that were the focus of an entire chapter, received other significant commentary, or are included in the Reviews section are listed below.)

The author is frank and vivid in describing her trauma-filled early life, to the point of inducing a nearly unbearable squirmy feeling of voyeurism in the reader (such as when she decsribes witnessing her mother's rape). But then, isn't that what horror films do? Janisse deftly weaves her personal stories of pain with analyses of horror and exploitation films, primarily those that are driven by female neuroses, either real or societally dictated -- from early '70s gialli to rape-revenge to Martyrs. You may not be able to see yourself in her stories, but you will enjoy the window into someone else's world.","(Films listed below are substantively discussed in the book; many other films are found in the book's Compendium)

This book resurrects that era in an attempt to explain it, and hopefully bury it forever. 

In 20 snappy chapters, authors from around the world of academia and pop culture each examine a small slice of the 1980s Satanic Panic, from Twisted Sister to pulp novels to Dungeons and Dragons. Films are the focus of several chapters, including Samm Deighan's fun history of heavy metal-themed horror films that will likely have you adding to your Netflix queue, and Kurt Halfyard's paean to The 'Burbs, which, at the end of the decade, was finally able to have some laughs about America's devil obsession. There are additional standouts, including Nastasi's chapter about Satan-worship themes in erotic fiction and Heller-Nicholas's chapter about a famous case of ""repressed memories"" chronicled in the non-fiction book Michelle Remembers. 

A delight for anyone with a personal history from the Satanic Panic era, and a fascinating time capsule for anyone who doesn't.","Ferguson, Kevin L. - Devil on the Line: Technology an the Satanic Film

Fairleigh Dickinson UP, 1990.",,,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Games_of_Terror/P6RZAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1958372.Games_of_Terror,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/823755883,"Dika's tome on the slasher trend from 1978-1981 is one of just two well-known academic treatments of the subject (the other being Carol J. Clover's Men, Women and Chainsaws; see separate entry on Horror Lex). In her introduction, Dika explains the conundrum that slashers provide: while the films are almost universally panned, teenagers eat them up, as evidenced by the huge box office success of even minor entrants into the subgenre.

Dika suggests that it is intellectually lazy, as well as inaccurate, to chalk up the success of slashers to their violence and gore. One of her most useful insights is that slashers excel at gaming: by use of point-of-view shots and other visual/auditory revelations to the audience about where the killer is and when and how he might strike, audiences are directly engaged in a game, and they show their engagement, often by yelling right back at the screen (""don't go in there!!""). The schlockier the effects (the ""anti-illusion""), the more audiences will interpret violence as a game, not reality.

Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the book is that Dika has clearly watched and paid attention to these much-maligned films, which many critics do not. She gets the plot details right -- in fact, she creates an entire deep structure for the films, which gets repeated in each iteration, all stemming from Psycho and Halloween -- and avoids making generalizations that she can't back up. Better yet, she smartly deflates generalizations from other writers that are still sometimes heard today (e.g., teen victims are always sexually promiscuous) and brings true innovation to the analysis of slashers, including regarding the function of the POV camera and nature of the Final Girl.

Published in 1990, Games of Terror is admittedly outdated; literally hundreds of slashers have been released since then, and it's missing the new slasher boom kicked off by Scream in 1996, plus the spate of remakes in the 2000s. Yet perhaps this works to the book's benefit, because it remains a time capsule of how slashers were perceived during and just after their initial boom. 

A must-read for any horror scholar or fan of the subgenre -- good luck finding a copy though, check your local library.","The Burning (1981)

Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film. 1996.

From author Williams' perspective, the American nuclear family is a harmful and ""dysfunctional institution"" that would be better off eliminated -- but you don't have to buy into that philosophy to enjoy this examination of horror emanting from the family's bosom. Families, Williams argues, are a veritable garden of the paranoia, threats, and violence that modern horror runs upon, and postmodern horror seems to agree. 

Hearths of Darkness is populated largely with detailed walk-throughs of key films with commentary from the author, organized roughly by film type. Williams starts with the classics, discussing (among others) Frankenstein and its sequels in terms of Mary Shelley's novel, which reflects her rage at rigid family and gender formations that affected her personally. Speaking of Psycho and the rest of Hitchcock's oeuvre, Williams offers that they depict men and women struggling against the Oedipal trajectory that patriarchy demands, often causing regression into psychosis. Next, Williams addresses the unholy trilogy of films in which families are infiltrated by Satanic impulses: Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist (and Exorcist II, which the author breathlessly endorses), and The Omen. 

Moving forward, Williams catalogs how family institutions became associated with the carnage of Vietnam, from the explicit (Deathdream) to the veiled (Last House on the Left, The Crazies), and associated with the apocalypse in Texas Chain Saw Massacre. He wraps up with a brief (and disapproving) survey of '80s slashers, whose monstrous fathers (Freddy, Jason, Michael) reflected the resurgence of patriarchal norms, and finally, sums up the golden '80s period of Stephen King adaptations.","(Note: Film index is taken from the first edition.)

While one could quibble with his thesis that gory horror movies form their own subgenre, there is no denying that, starting in earnest in the 1960s, gore exploded both as an art form and as a cinematic goal. Writing in 1981, McCarty was the vanguard on this topic. In fact, the datedness of the book is a handicap, given how much ""splatter"" came after its publication. At the same time, it remains a fascinating glimpse of the scene at the time it was still fresh and controversial.

McCarty begins with a brief history of gory entertainment and censorship thereof, from the Grand Guignol theater to early filmmakers such as D.W. Griffiths. At that point, his book becomes a chronological guide, starting with Hammer films; moving to Herschell Gordon Lewis, Night of the Living Dead, and Cronenberg; and then the ""mainstream"" tentpole films of the 1970s and early '80s. 

Don't miss the Easter egg interviews: starting on page 101, McCarty talks to a hot-property David Cronenberg, fresh off Scanners, and at page 124, there's a chat with Tom Savini just before the debut of Creepshow. This is a handsome book, albeit with only black-and-white photos. Picking up a gently-used copy may be worth your time.","(Note: Only those films that the author discusses in any detail are listed below.

American Nightmare: Essays on the Horror Film,"Wood, Robin and Richard Lippe (Eds.)",,1979,Festival of Festivals,,Out of print,"Wood, Robin and Richard Lippe, editors. American Nightmare: Essays on the Horror Film. Festival of Festivals, 1979.",https://epdf.pub/queue/american-nightmare-essays-on-the-horror-film.html,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36152907-american-nightmare,,"American Nightmare is a publication more often referred to than actually read. Part of that is due to its unusual origin -- as a 100-page pamphlet distributed to attendees of the 1979 Festival of Festivals (now known as the Toronto Film Festival), at which Robin Wood and some of his like-minded critics presented on the horror film. At the time, placing horror films among ""serious"" films and writing about them with academic pretentions was unheard of. Thus, the 100-page pamphlet (which is available free on the web, see link) has gone down in history as the beginning of the acceptance of horror films as a genre worthy of study. 

That being said, there is not much diversity in this first attempt. Wood, Lippe, and fellow authors Andrew Britton and Tony Williams were all cut from similar cloth -- left-wing/Marxist in political stance, and firm believers in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which would dominate horror criticism for the next decade or longer. And while Wood (and perhaps others) explicitly identified as a feminist, there's not a woman to be found here. Still, this is essential reading for anyone interested in 1970s critical film history or looking for a firm grounding in the principles that guide today's horror critics.

One particular chapter that has gone on to become cannon is Wood's Introduction to the American Horror Film. In this essay, Wood fleshes out his Freud-based theory of the underpinning of all horror films, which is that the return of a societally repressed desire is the monster, which threatens normality.","Wood, Robin - Introduction to the American Horror Film

Softball. Canoeing. Macramé. And often, a hotbed of gender anxiety and first loves. Sixteen contributors offer their takes on the intersection between queer sexuality and the phenomenon of attending camp. The authors' perspectives are broad-ranging, covering experiences of girls, boys, Americans, Jews, Australians, even kids in Japanese internment camps. Linking most of their stories is Susan Sontag's famous ""Notes on Camp,"" a 1964 essay (not included here, but free online) which was arguably the first attempt to define the camp sensibility from an academic standpoint. As the essays demonstrate, the ""camp"" experience and the ""camp"" aesthetic share more than a coincidental name.

Chris McGee's chapter on Sleepaway Camp (1983), ""one of the most bizarre and infamous entries"" in the slasher movie canon, explains how the film ""tells both a literal queer story"" in the gender-bending character of Angela ""and an odder, deeper, queerer, more complex story in its subtext."" McGee explores the film's surface-level depiction of queerness as monstrous, but posits that Angela, in truth, is the film's most sympathetic figure: the one who suffers most from the demands of heteronormativity and bullying in a classic American summer camp setting, with their swimsuits and communal showers.

Author Gehring name-checks seminal films and offers a brief comment on their significance. 

Most interesting is Gehring's take on the 1970s. While he nods in the direction of the auteurs Kubrick, Friedkin, and Spielberg, he asserts that “the best work has actually been done by supposedly second-rate directors,"" Cronenberg, Hooper, Craven, and Ferrera. He has particular love for Ferrera's Ms. 45, which offers a “refreshing inversion” of violent film plots. The author also provides a useful (if now very outdated) review of relevant books and journals.","Bedlam (1946)

Author Badley describes 1980s horror culture, with its gore and nauseating effects, as ""a spectacle offering not mere transcendence of the body but transcendence through the body."" This gothic body, as she demonstrates, manifested in film. Think of the hauntings from spectral, womb-like spaces (such as in Poltergeist and The Shining) spawned by characters' empty souls. Or, the vulnerable, revolting bodies (and bodies in revolt) in zombie films and gore-heavy flicks like Re-Animator. 

Badley also questions the theory that slasher flicks are always bad for women, and devotes two chapters to movies directed by men that ""began to invert and challenge the patriarchal codes of the genre."" This includes Body Double (""an elaborate, self-referential joke"" about misogyny) and the entire early Cronenberg ouevre. Her final chapter examines The Silence of the Lambs (a ""women's picture""), the theme of the mother, and the cross-gender play that both Clarice Starling and Jame Gumb engage in ""out of a similar need, emptiness, and loss.""","The Addams Family (1991)

Finley does not take a principled position that violent media makes violent people (although one wonders why she would bother to write this book otherwise), but instead keeps a rather dry distance.  

In the Film section, horror films are discussed with respect to individual seminal films, and series and trends (e.g., blaxploitation, slasher films). However, the text rarely goes beyond a description of the plot and violent content in each film.","28 Days Later (2002)

Dery warns readers upfront that if one is looking for ""point-by-point exposition and the methodical accumulation of evidence,"" best look elsewhere. Instead, expect highly esoteric yet readable musings on politics, mass media, and hidden corners of millennial life, loosely bound into a psychoanalytic/philosophical framework.

While none of Dery's essays centers directly on horror films, Wes Craven's Scream series figures prominently in the first chapter, in which Dery identifies Edward Munch's 19th-century painting The Scream (reflected in the cinematic killer's costume) as ""the poster child for self-mocking millennial dread."" In Chapter 2, the author finds creepy clowns, from Pennywise to the Killer Klowns from Outer Space to John Wayne Gacy, to fill the role of ""agents of chaos"" whose symbolic sacrifice is a ""means of appeasing the turbulent forces that seem to be pulling our world off its axis"" as it hurtles toward the millennium. Finally, in Chapter 12, Kenneth Branaugh's cinematic version of Frankenstein gets a brief mention in Dery's essay on new concepts of birth.","Chapter 1: Have an Angst Day: The Scream Meme

In one corner, Freddy Krueger, the dream king of the lucrative Nightmare on Elm Street series. In the other, Jason Voorhees, prolific slasher from the Friday the 13th movies. It may have seemed like a natural pairing, à là Frankenstein meeting the Wolf Man. But insiders know that it was a long, long, looooong road to this match-up, and McNeill is here to dish on every last detail.

In Slash of the Titans, McNeill describes the initial conception of a Freddy vs Jason film, way back in the mid-1980s, and then steers readers into a chronological trip through 10 major draft screenplays and treatments of the film that would take the rest of the decade to suss out. (In fact, as McNeill notes, it would take a formal arbitration by the Writers Guild to determine the  screenwriting credits for the finished film.) The drafts ranged from the dull (copycat killers, ho hum) to the offbeat (a ""Fredhead"" fan cult, and Jason goes on trial!) to the truly WTF (Freddy had sex with Jason's mom??). McNeill neatly summarizes them all, and adds his original interviews with nearly all the major players, including the screenwriters, New Line and Cunningham Productions execs, and Robert Englund.

This may be obvious, but Slash of the Titans is for diehard Nightmare and/or Friday fans only. (And only the diehard could be expected to wade through this typo-ridden edition; not sure this got any editing at all.) Thankfully, McNeill addresses many burning questions that fans have had about Freddy vs Jason. Why wasn't Kane Hodder playing Jason? Where did the versions with Pinhead and Ash from The Evil Dead go? And why on Earth does Jason appear to be afraid of water, given that he spent Friday XIII voluntarily swimming from New Jersey to New York City? 

If you read only one book about Freddy vs Jason -- and let's face it, the world only needs one -- let this be it.","Freddy vs. Jason (2003)

Harker, 2019.",,,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Taking_Shape/nuV_ygEACAAJ?hl=en,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53009512-taking-shape,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1127953597,"In the last few years, horror lovers have been gifted with comprehensive retrospectives on several horror franchises, but the Halloween series has been neglected until now. Authors McNeill and Mullins aim to provide an A-to-Z history of the original 1978 John Carpenter film and its many sequels and reboots (and sequels to the reboots, and reboots of the sequels) over the last 40 years. 

Taking Shape is structured chronologically by film, with the discussion almost entirely focused on the film's various texts: original and alternative versions of the script, the narrative and plot of the movie as filmed, deleted scenes, edited-for-television versions, directors' and producers' cuts, and post-film novelizations. Some readers, especially more casual Halloween fans, may find this tack overly repetitive or just plain dull. (If you don't care whether the first version of the Halloween 5 script had The Man in Black wearing a suit rather than a cowboy duster, this won't change things.) But slasher fans, by their nature, tend to love repetition and will probably revel in every new nugget of information (e.g., the scene with the retractable gym-floor pool that was cut out of cost concerns from Halloween: H20, which would have been a-ma-zing). And even for those well-versed in Hollywood Halloween lore, there will be plenty of new information here, including 17 new interviews with directors, writers, producers, and others involved in the making of the films.

The narrow focus of Taking Shape does mean that extra-textual consideration of the series is virtually absent. The only film that receives any deeper consideration is the original Halloween (1978), and the authors ultimately adopt the director's own infamous view of the film: in short, it's just about a guy who kills people, and everyone should stop looking for more meaning.","Black Christmas (1974)

Stephen King, R.L. Stine, and Anne Rice books were in every home, The X-Files was on TV, and a Hannibal Lecter movie won Best Picture. 

Putting aside the obvious, the author focuses on The Gothic (""the art of haunting"") in more hidden nooks of the decade, spurred by our pre-millennial anxiety and need to find deeper meaning in the darkness due to our sharply decreased reliance on religiosity. This includes the O.J. Simpson case, which Edmundson argues is a ""Gothic slasher"" and classic Jekyll-and-Hyde tale; afternoon talk shows, which wallow in trauma, recovered memories, and historical retellings; and even the ""pop transcendent,"" anti-Gothic celebrated in Forrest Gump. 

In short, there is no element of 1990s pop culture or tabloid news (Tanya Harding!) that Edmundson cannot wedge into a Gothic box. The author gives shallow treatment to horror fims, but seeing him move from Freddy Kreuger to The Lion King to Camille Paglia to Foucault in the space of a few pages is a stunt some may want to see for themselves.","Carrie (1976)

Anyone who grew up in the '60s-'90s, before movies could be had with a few clicks of a remote, remembers glueing themselves to the TV set at an appointed time or setting the VCR to catch something violent, scary, salacious, or just plain exciting on TV, such as Dark Night of the Scarecrow (1981) and Mother May I Sleep With Danger? (1996). 

While not limited to horror-themed TV movies, the book notes their special place in this corner of history. The television movie ""became a looking glass into the world of genre cinema,"" Reyes notes, especially for those who lived outside major cities and had no access to grindhouse moviehouses or rare videotapes. 

Are You in the House Alone? is best used as a reference book rather than a cover-to-cover read. The essays, written by Reyes and guests, are brief and do little more than collect and recap films on the same topic. Yet horror fans will especially appreciate Lance Vaughan's overview of Stephen King TV adaptations, including the still-nightmare-inducing Salem's Lot (1979) and It (1990). Also notable is Jennifer Wallis's thoughtful roundup of rape-revenge TV films, in which she considers them against the political backdrop of the times. 

The back half of the book contains a nearly comprehensive set of reviews of made-for-TV movies in each decade, the most engaging of which are written by Reyes herself and guest reviewers Kier-La Janisse and Kevin Hilton. Your nostalgia will surely be triggered, and your Netflix list will surely grow, after perusing.

Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide To Slasher Movies,"Harper, Jim",9781900486392 (paperback),2004,Headpress/Critical Vision,,https://headpress.com/product/legacy-of-blood/,"Harper, Jim. Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide To Slasher Movies. Headpress, 2004.",,,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Legacy_of_Blood/kAxPsnCDPWgC?hl=en&gbpv=0,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/274598.Legacy_of_Blood,http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937275821,"Author Harper starts his book with a sparse yet competent march through slasher history, grounded in the opinion that Halloween is the apex of slasherdom and everything else that followed, save A Nightmare on Elm Street or two, was an increasing disappointment. This is perhaps a defensible position, but seems an odd one for someone dedicating an entire book to the slasher subgenre. 

More worthwhile is Harper’s 25-page slasher anatomy lesson, in which he dissects slasher tropes. He enthusiastically joins the debate on Final Girls (and offers fresh insight into the “virginal or nay?” question), the nature of the killer, and the classic setting of isolation. The heart of the book, though, is in Harper’s reviews of 190 slasher pix. While he misses key films (no The Funhouse?) at the same time, he lists many others that are new to this die-hard slasher fan, particular from the early aughts. 

In the end, though, Harper's neutral-to-negative tone throughout the reviews is puzzling, as if the author has an intellectual curiosity about slashers but no true love for their goofy charm. Simply put, if you don't love Bloody Moon and Pieces, we can’t be friends. ","Absurd (a.k.a. Horrible) (1981)

Her goal: to shame misogyny and promote the equality of women in film, not just in the director's chair and other positions of power, but on screen. 

Haskell begins with ""The Big Lie,"" that is, that women are inferior -- intellectually, physically, emotionally -- and thus may be fairly depicted in film as objects of subjection and sacrifice. She then proves her point by mulling through four decades of Hollywood output, in which actresses are steadfastly prevented from depicting their characters as people. Instead, they were virgins, whores, harridans. Women were rarely protagonists rather than ""an adjunct to man"" - except, of course, in so-called ""women's films,"" the existence of which speaks for itself. Not that Haskell spends the entire book merely listing films and complaining. Her deep affection for cinema and knowledge of the plots, metaphors, and meanings of films from the '20s through the early '70s is self-evident, and, thankfully, she can find small corners of female victory.

Horror fans will find little to chew on here; the seminal horror and sci-fi films of the '30s through the '50s are almost completely untouched. But it's worth the wait: in her chapter regarding the '60s, Haskell unleashes a truly blistering critique on certain auteurs of the day -- Polanski, Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Peckinpah -- whose work and choice of actresses reveal deep, real-life chauvinism.","2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)

The book is not greatly concerned with the horror genre, except for Gérard Lenne's chapter regarding the figure of women as both victims and monsters in horror films. Lenne notes the different roles that women play in different ""fantastic"" narratives -- such as the sexually active role for female characters in vampire films -- but resignedly admits that every time, she is relegated to the bottom ranks, or secondary in importance to mere beauty. Even when she is the monster, she is never one of the ""great psychopaths, the figureheads of the fantastic.""

Fewer have treated horror not merely as a collection of films, but as a culture. Editor Conrich has put together this volume to fill that gap. The 15 all-star contributors address different aspects of being a modern horror consumer and fan: horror as multifaceted entertainment, spreading to theme parks and blockbuster films; the technological expansion of the horror subculture, including online communities; and the cultural boundaries pushed by horror. 

The span of this book is vast and the topics varied, but a few chapters stood out. Hands down, the favorite is Julian Petley's Chapter 12, which attempts to bring some historical sense to the gruesome ""Nazi horrors"" subgenre, peaking in the 1970s with the SS and Ilsa films. Also worthwhile are Chapter 8, a brief but entertaining look at the different strategies in set design and costuming in three films based on serial killer Ed Gein, and Chapter 11, which sees parallels in the body aesthetics of splatter films like Pieces and hard-core pornography.","Ndalianis, Angela - Chapter 1: Dark Rides, Hybrid Machines and the Horror Experience

The themes are almost uniformly unhappy ones -- trauma, neglect, sexual abuse, war. As author Lury writes in the introduction, her inspiration was the sense that, as depicted cinematically, the child and childhood ""occupy a situation in which they are 'other': other to the supposedly rational, civilised, 'grown up' human animal that is the adult.""

Two chapters touch on the horror genre, primarily Chapter 1, where Lury examines Japanese horror films centering on ghostly children, many of which were remade for American audiences. She finds something distinctive about the use of the child in the Japanese versions of the stories. Sadako (Ringu), Mitsuko (Dark Water), and similar bereft, dead kids represent a warped perspective of time. By serving as a constant reminder of a troubled past, they now threaten the coherence of the present, and essentially collapse the two. The location of the troubled past within the figure of a child -- as both victim and threat -- is also meaningful, Lury writes. To Japan, a nation that suffered both post-World War II trauma and a deep recession in the 1990s, the fate of children was heavily invested in as a symbol of national identity. The failure of those children to thrive, or worse, their abandonment or murder, carries meaning beyond the children themselves.

In Chapter 3, Lury surveys films that depict war through the eyes and experiences of children. While most of the films are dramas, not horror, she does point to Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth as an example of a film that depicts war through a fairytale lens, with a focus on children interacting with elemental powers (fire, earth).","Chapter One: Hide and Seek: Children and Ghosts in Contemporary Japanese Film

True to the mid-1980s era of these writings, certain approaches predominate: feminist, psychoanalytic, Marxist, and philosophical. 

Modleski herself contributes a chapter on horror films, where she defends against criticism of slashers and other ""low"" genre forms merely because they provide  predictable, visceral pleasures. To the contrary, she claims, horror films can be seen as the kind of transgressive, anti-bourgeois force that Marxist/postmodernists have been looking for. Movies such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and The Brood (1979) present ""an unprecedented assault on all that bourgeois culture is supposed to cherish,"" like the patriarchal family. Such films also engender ""joyful self-destructiveness"" on the part of the audience, who cheer at mad slashers killing teenagers they never really knew, and destroying a social order they don't actually cherish.","Modleski, Tania - Chapter 9: The Terror of Pleasure: The Contemporary Horror Film and Postmodern Theory

The figure of the kyai -- an Islamic scholar and relgious leader --  featured prominently in narratives as a means of making their otherwise scandalous subject matter viable under strict censorship laws. Yet changing tastes and politics have altered the meaning of kyai and, in the case of reality TV, the kyai has been repurposed as proof of the ""realness"" of ghosts and other phenomena.","Chapter 5: The kyai and hyperreal ghosts: narrative practices of horror, commerce, and censorship

(His first was 2005's Japanese Horror Cinema, an anthology.) This is not an encyclopedia, but rather a thoughtful thesis on the intersection between film and culture. McRoy takes into account radical shifts in Japan's post-World War II economy, politics, and gender roles, as well as its ""re-conceptualisations of the very notion of cultural and national boundaries.""

Each chapter focuses on a particular corner of Japanese film -- and boy, does McRoy know how to pick the most gruesome corners. Chapters 1 and 2 address the extreme end of faux snuff and body horror/torture films, such as the Guinea Pig series, which McRoy traces back to several historical points in which the body of Japanese culture was at risk from Westernization and a threatened national identity. Genital censorship and Japanese ideals of bodily purity and sexuality, deeply skewered in the ""pink"" films (pinku eiga), are considered in Chapter 2, along with reactions to Japanese feminism and technology. Chapter 3 concerns the tentpole films that comprise the conventional definition of J-horror (Ringu, etc.) and the dual threat-promise of technology in postmodern Japan.

McRoy is at his most compelling when tackling themes that make little sense outside a Japanese cultural context, such as his discussion of ijime, or ""dove-style violence,"" in films such as All About Lily Chou-Chou (2001) and Ichi the Killer (2001) (Chapter 4). These utterly disturbing flicks depict collective atrocities by an in-group against an outsider, which McRoy identifies as Darwinian in nature and ""a component of a larger paradigmatic cycle of violence and suffering permeating contemporary Japanese culture."" In Chapter 5, he delves into the peculiarly post-war Japanese version of apocalypse, marked by social alienation, self-sacrifice (Suicide Club (2002)) and cosmic patterns working through technology (Spiral/Uzumaki (2000) and Pulse/Kairo (2001)). 

If there is any flaw in McRoy's approach in Nightmare Japan, it is his tendency to throw too much at the audience. There are a lot of ideas mashed together here, and just when he's getting to a solid point, he often whips around to make a completely different one. But in terms of a true cultural analysis of Japan and horror, you cannot do better.","All About Lily Chou-Chou (2001)

In her chapter, author Jane Caputi (a well-known historian of myth and the horror genre) tackles the grim end of the latter subject: pornography and gore films. Caputi is firmly on the side of anti-porn feminists, and draws a direct line between mistreatment of women in pornographic films and the rape and killing of women, which she calls ""a fundamental need of the masculinist [patriarchal] state."" For gore-horror, she is no more forgiving -- in fact, she notes the similarities between two particular films, one deemed softcore porn and the other a horror film, but both depicting sexual torture of women. Caputo sees the extreme end (snuff films, real or fake) as merely different in degree from the popular end (Psycho, slasher films, even fashion advertisements) and condemns them all.","Caputi, Jane - Advertising Femicide: Lethal Violence against Women in Pornography and Gorenorgraphy

Author Braudy tackles several centuries of history and a wide array of monsters in art and myth to comment on how fear is shaped and, in turn, shapes our world. 

Braudy's consideration of horror in film (as opposed to literature) is spotty throughout most of the book, but he gives sustained attention to a few select works. This includes 1931's Dracula, which Braudy includes as part of his analysis of the Gothic pull of the monstrous past, as well as the preoccupation with the sexual power of women. He also devotes Chapter 8, Horror in the Age of Visual Reproduction, to film, discussing the unique abilities of the medium to deepen the horror response in viewers while modernizing ancient tropes.
