<p>It’s Thanksgiving here in the States, when we’ll all gather around a roast turkey and trimmings for our annual feast of gratitude. (Professor Lex prefers his meat raw, but remains partial to pumpkin pie.)</p><p><img alt="" src="https://a.storyblok.com/f/135015/1324x882/7f91f448b5/thanksgiving.jpeg" title="" /></p><p>Something else is bountiful here at Horror Lex: great writings on horror film and food. While you’re digesting and watching (or ignoring) the football game, why not take a look?</p><ul><li><p>Michael Newbury – “<a href="https://horrorlex.com/fast-zombieslow-zombie-food-writing-horror-movies-and-agribusiness-apocalypse" target="_self" linktype="url">Fast Zombie/Slow Zombie: Food Writing, Horror Movies, and Agribusiness Apocalypse</a>” (<i>American Literary History</i>, Spring 2012)</p><p>Using Danny Boyle&#39;s <i>28 Days Later</i> as a springboard, Newbury discusses &quot;the dislodging of humans from their comfortable place atop the industrial food chain&quot; as the defining feature of the modern zombie film.</p></li><li><p>Mark Bernard – “Cannibalism, Class and Power: A Foodways Analysis of <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> Series” (<i>Food, Culture &amp; Society</i>, Sept. 2011)</p><p>Bernard looks at three <i>Texas Chain Saw</i> films from a socio-political perspective as movies about food. In the original film, cannibals are starving members of the working class whose food choice is foisted upon them by economics. In the third, cannibalism is portrayed as the natural order of things in a capitalistic society. In the 2006 prequel, the cannibal is now a &quot;[middle] class warrior&quot; who follows an &quot;&#39;eat or be eaten&#39; philosophy of American militarism and imperialism.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Cynthia J. Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, editors – <a href="https://horrorlex.com/whats-eating-you-food-and-horror-on-screen" linktype="url"><i>What’s Eating You? Food and Horror on Screen</i></a> (Bloomsbury Academic, 2017)</p><p>As the editors explain, food isn’t just about sustenance; it&#39;s about belief systems. What we choose to eat, what we forbid from being eaten, and our own fear of being eaten (by fellow human or beast) are deeply ingrained into our identities. Thus the editors present this series of essays about food and eating in the horror film, from Hollywood hits to obscurities (seriously, this may be the only chance you have to witness an academic take on <i>Poultrygeist</i>).</p><p>A special gold star goes to contributor Mark Henderson for managing to pen a grown-up discussion of consumerism and classism in the <i>Human Centipede</i> series that is surprisingly...tasteful (sorry, not sorry) (Ch. 11).</p></li></ul>
